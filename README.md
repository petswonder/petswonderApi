# üõçÔ∏è e-Commerce with node.js and MVC pattern

_node.js, express, JavaScript, ES6, MySQL, MVC pattern, Backend_

## üìî Description

In this project, we developed an e-commerce web application using the MVC pattern, node.js, MySql and other related technologies.

On the one hand, customers are able to see and purchase products, while on the other the employees can perform CRUD operations to manage the product portfolio.

### üìÇ Content

The repository contains the files and folders detailed below:

- **_public_**: contains all the files shared with the users of the application, such as images, stylesheets and scripts.

- **_src_**: it is the root folder of the project, divided into sub-folders which are structured as per the chosen project architecture (the MVC pattern): _config_, _controllers_, _models_, _routes_, _seed_ and _views_.

- **_.env-template_**: a file with the individual user environment variables needed to run the application.

- **_.gitignore_**: used to indicate the files and folders to be ignored by the version control system _Git_.

- **_README.md_**: this file.

- **_app.js_**: main entry point to the application, with the set up of our server with _**express**_ and calls (via `import`) to the different _npm_ packages used in the project.

- **_package-lock.json_**: automatically generated file used for any operations where the package manager _npm_ modifies either the _node_modules_ tree (not included in this repository) or the file _package.json_.

- **_package.json_**: contains information about the project (name, version, etc.) including the packages installed as dependencies.
